- ✅ **No git commands needed** - just drag and drop or use CLI
- ✅ **Instant deployment** - live in 2 minutes
- ✅ **Free forever** for hobby projects

- ✅ **Custom domain** support (optional)
- ✅ **Automatic updates** when you reconnect your GitHub repo

## 🎯 Option 3: Fix GitHub Pages (Manual)

If you really want to use GitHub Pages, try this workaround:

### Go to your repository and try GitHub's built-in Pages setup:

1. **Go to repository settings:**
   https://github.com/Fepilot/Copilot-Adoption-Navigator/settings/pages

2. **Click on "Learn more about configuring the publishing source"** link

3. **Try selecting "GitHub Actions" instead of "Deploy from a branch"**

4. **Choose the "Next.js" workflow** if available

OR

**Try this direct approach:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Fepilot/Copilot-Adoption-Navigator
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Click **"New workflow"**
4. Search for **"Next.js"**
5. Click **"Configure"** on the "Deploy Next.js site to Pages" workflow
6. Click **"Commit changes"**

This will use GitHub Actions to deploy automatically.

## 🏆 My Recommendation: Use Vercel

**Why:**
- ✅ Works immediately (no branch detection issues)
- ✅ Better for Next.js apps (created by the same company)
- ✅ Free forever
- ✅ Faster deployment
- ✅ Better developer experience
- ✅ Can still keep your code on GitHub

**Your final URL will be:**
```
https://copilot-adoption-navigator.vercel.app
```

(or a custom domain if you prefer)
