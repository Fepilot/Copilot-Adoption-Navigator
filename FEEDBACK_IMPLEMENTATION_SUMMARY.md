## üíæ Data Storage Notes

**Important:**
- Feedback is stored in **browser localStorage** (client-side only)
- Data is **browser-specific** (not synced across devices)
- Data is **user-specific** (not shared between team members)
- **Always export to CSV** before clearing browser cache

**For Team Collaboration:**
- Each team member submits feedback from their browser
- You (the presenter) collect all feedback in your browser
- Export to CSV and share with stakeholders
- Consider copying high-priority items to Azure DevOps/Jira for permanent tracking

- **Character Counters**: Real-time feedback on input length
