## üîÑ Complete User Flow

### 1. Discovery Phase
- User enters metrics on `/inputs`
- System generates recommendations on `/results`
- User reviews recommendations with gap analysis

### 2. Planning Phase
- User clicks "Add to Plan" on recommendations
- System creates or uses existing active plan
- Recommendations appear in "Planned" column on `/plans`

### 3. Execution Phase
- User clicks "Start" to begin execution
- Recommendation moves to "In Progress" column
- User logs activities:
  - Outreach sent (emails, Teams messages)
  - Events held (lunch & learns, workshops)
  - Learning assigned (courses, tutorials)
  - Checkpoints reached (progress updates)

### 4. Capture Phase
- User records metric snapshots:
  - Baseline: Initial metric value
  - Checkpoint: Mid-execution values
  - Final: End-of-execution value
- User provides feedback:
  - Success stories
  - Challenges faced
  - Quotes from users
  - Suggestions

### 5. Outcome Phase
- User marks recommendation as "Success" or "Didn't Help"
- Recommendation moves to "Done" column
- System calculates Evidence Score:
  - Delta: Improvement from baseline to final
  - Coverage: % of audience reached (from engagement events)
  - Persistence: Sustained impact (from checkpoints)
  - Evidence Score = delta √ó coverage √ó persistence

### 6. Evidence Phase
- User views leaderboard on `/evidence`:
  - Win Rate: % of successful recommendations
  - Avg Delta: Average improvement
  - Avg Coverage: Average reach
  - Avg Persistence: Average sustained impact
- User drills into top recommendations
- User exports Evidence Cards with:
  - Before/after charts
  - Activities timeline
  - Engagement stats
  - Feedback quotes
  - Next steps

## üìà Evidence Score Examples

- **Success**: ‚úì Yes (exceeded 10% threshold)

### Example 2: Moderate Impact
- **Baseline**: 0.8 hours/week assisted
- **Final**: 1.4 hours/week assisted
- **Delta**: +0.6 (75% improvement)
- **Coverage**: 20% (2 events)
- **Persistence**: 60% (1 checkpoint over 6 weeks)
- **Evidence Score**: 0.6 √ó 0.2 √ó 0.6 = **0.072**
- **Success**: ‚úì Yes (exceeded 20% threshold for this metric)

### Example 3: Limited Success
